Great question! Yes — you can absolutely make **a simple browser extension just for yourself** on your computer, without publishing it to the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Here's how you can do it, step-by-step:

---

## 🧩 How a Local Browser Extension Would Work

### ✅ What You’ll Be Doing:

You'll wrap your `DOM Inspector Plus` script into a browser extension that:

* **Injects the script into pages you visit**
* Shows the inspector automatically when you click on any element

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Make a Chrome Extension Locally

### 1. **Create a Folder (e.g., `dom-inspector-extension/`)**

Inside it, create these 3 files:

---

### 🗂️ `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "DOM Inspector Plus",
  "description": "Click any element to inspect its properties.",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab"],
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Enable DOM Inspector"
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  }
}
```

---

### 🗂️ `background.js`

```js
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    files: ["inspector.js"]
  });
});
```

---

### 🗂️ `inspector.js`

Paste your full **DOM Inspector Plus** script into this file.

---

### ✅ 2. **Load Your Extension in Chrome**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select your `dom-inspector-extension/` folder

You’ll see your extension appear as an icon in the toolbar.

---

### ✅ 3. **Use It**

1. Visit any webpage.
2. Click the extension’s icon.
3. Your DOM Inspector will be injected and active — just click any element to inspect it.

---

## 📦 Notes

* **Works only on pages you click the icon for.** You can change this to auto-inject on all sites if you want.
* **Completely local** — no upload or publishing needed.
* You can easily edit the script anytime by changing `inspector.js`.

---

## 🧪 Want Firefox Instead?

Firefox supports similar steps. The main differences are:

* Use `manifest_version: 2`
* You load extensions via `about:debugging`

Let me know if you want the Firefox setup too!
